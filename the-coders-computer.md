# My Reading Notes for Module Two
## The Coder's Computer

**Hi, everyone**

I am back again, this time to give some insight into the Coder's Computer. This week was all about learning the _terminal_ in your computer and the _commands_ that can be done in the terminal as well as how to choose a **text editor**. Think of it as haivng a conversation with your computer via the _terminal_. The terminal can be pretty daunting to be in at first, but with practice this shall dwindle down. Friends, the terminal in your computer is pretty much an app that is your computer's operatng system. We can code in the terminal via **commands**. In my opinion it sure sounds easier than what looks like. A **text editor** is software that you download and install on to your computer. Text editors allow you to write and manage text especially to _build a website_. There are four important features to look for when choosing a text editor for you and your computer. Here is a list:

1. **Code completion** (for help writing your code + making it faster)
2. **Syntax highlighing** (to help you read your code better- different colors/more noticable)
3. **Nice vareity of themes** (think aesthetic, dark/ligh mode- helpful to reduce eye strain & fatigue)
4. Ability to choose from a good amount of **extensions** avaliable for when you need them (think power side tools to make your job easier)

For this module, as part of learning the terminal we learned some commands that I am going to share:

+ _pwd_ command tells you where you are at, think of the text abbreviation WYA
+ _ls_ command will give you a list of directories of where you are at, think what else is here?
+ _cd_ command is how you move throughout your terminal
+ _mkdir_ command is how you can make a directory and or folder
+ _touch_ command will be used to create a new file- remember you have to tell it what kind of file it is

I will also include what what is going on shall you see these commands:

- **cd projects** is saying move to directory named "projects"
- **mkdir new-projects** is saying create a new folder or directory and name it "new-projects"
- **touch new-project/newfile.md** is saying a new file was created with said name and it is a markdown file
- **cd ..** is saying go back twice as if you were moving backwards when you click the back arrow
- **ls projects/new-project** is saying hey, these directories are here and these are the names of said directories

  That's all I have for today and my understanding of of the information from module two. It is alot to process in one sitting, but hope this blog post helps in some way.
Until next time,

  V.
