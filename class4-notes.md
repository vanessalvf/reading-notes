**My Reading Notes for Module Four**

## **Structure Web Pages with HTML**


1. What is HTML and why do we use it?
    - HTML stands for **hyper link markup langauge** and it is a way to _structure_ content on a webpage allowing others to see the content on the webpage.

2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?
    - The 3 main parts are a start tag, the content and an end tag. It looks like this (without the spaces): 
    **< _content goes here_ />**

3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?
    - **an _attribute_**

4. What is a semantic element?
    - A semantic element is the meaning of a piece of code aka telling you the meaning of the content they hold. Example(again no spaces): **< header > < footer >**
