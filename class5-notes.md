**My Reading Notes for Module Five**

## **Design Web Pages with CSS**


1. What is the purpose of CSS?
    - CSS is used to _style_ webpages- it's the back end work for how the _presentation_ of our webpage will look from color, to borders, margins, text and images will be shown on our webpage. Think of CSS as bringing your webpage mental idea to life.

2. What are the 3 ways to insert CSS into your project?
    + **EXTERNAL CSS** (you have an external style sheet where yoour css goes and then your html file is linked to that style sheet, once they both know the other file exsists the css changes can be recognized by the html file)
    - **INTERNAL CSS** (the css rules you want your webpage to follow are added into your html file instead of onto an external file)
    * **INLINE CSS** (per Kassie, inline css might not be the best practice because it means more work in the end because for example if you want to change the background color of a page and you have multiple pages, you would have to go in to each part of the page and change it one by one. Think smart, not hard)

3. Wrtie an example of a CSS rule that would give all < p > elements red text.
    - < p style="color:red;">my text would go here.</ p>
