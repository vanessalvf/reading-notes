***GROWTH MINDSET***

Growth mindset to me means that I am not putting limits on my ability to learn and grow my knowledge. I can learn anything if I put in the effort. Reminders for myself on how to stay in a growth mindset include:
1. Tell myself "I can't figure it out YET".
2. Learning is fun, although hard sometimes, you enjoy learning.
3. The success of my team is my success as my success if also my team's success. We can grow with those around us.
