# My Reading Notes From Module One
**Hi, friends**
**on today's blog post I'll be talking about new coding concepts I am learning for my Code Fellows class**

_Markdown, Markdown, Markdown_ seems to be the most important to understand and with good cause because Markdown is a language that is used to generate html files. Or as I like to put it, it's the the idea side of a website you have to put together to get the all nice and formatted view of said website. We use syntax in Markdown to indicate which words and phrases will look **different**. See what I did there ;)
We are learning and using Markdown because of these reasons:

1. Markdown is _everywhere_

2. Markdown is portable and in case you lose your info in the future, you can still read your markdown formatted text
3. Markdown can be used for everything, example- creating websites, books and documents

Some stuff I have learned to do using Markdown is using the pound sign(#) to create a heading. The number of pound signs that you use will determine the size and hierarchy of the headings, so one pound sign for the largest heading and more than one pound sign to the heading after the first for it to be smaller.
Example:
# this is one heading

## this is my second heading

### this is my third heading

As you can see the headings get smaller and that is do to the number of pound signs I put in my format before the heading.
In Markdown, if you want to make your words a little **fancy** like so, you would put two star signs before the word you want in bold and after the word. Think of it as surrounding your word in four little cute stars (two on each side).
If what you want to add to your page is a link, Markdown allows you to do so. Doing so requires you to wrap brackets [] around your link texts, then wrapping the URL you want in parenthesis ().
Shall you find yourself wanting to make a list in Markdown you use any of these symbols before your text -+* to make an _unordered_ bulleted list with Markdown.

Well friends, that is all I have so far to share from my coding journey.
Till next time,
